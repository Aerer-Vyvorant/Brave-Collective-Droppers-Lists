# Brave-Collective-Droppers-Lists

This repository contains files with the names of known droppers in our space for use by alliance members, either in tools or for reference.

Modification feb 16, 2024
To allow easy usage by applications, the names have been placed in an Excel spreadsheet that was then exported to csv and further converted to json.
All 3 files are uploaded and will be updated when new names are raised.
